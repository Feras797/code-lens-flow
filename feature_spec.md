## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Components**: shadcn/ui component library
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Visualization**: Recharts
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Theme**: Dark-first optimized for developers

### Design System
- **Theme**: Dark-first theme optimized for developer workflows
- **Status Colors**:
  - Flow: Green (productive state)
  - Slow: Yellow (problem solving)
  - Blocked: Red (needs intervention)
- **Priority Colors**: Subtle accents (high: red, medium: yellow, low: green)
- **Principles**:
  - Minimal design focused on information density
  - Distraction-free interface for flow state
  - Responsive layout across devices
  - Real-time updates with smooth animations

### Data Models

```typescript
interface Developer {
  id: number
  name: string
  avatar: string
  status: 'flow' | 'slow' | 'stuck'
  workItems: WorkItem[]
  totalMessages: number
  totalCommits: number
  currentContext: string
}

interface WorkItem {
  id: string
  task: string
  file: string
  duration: string
  messages: number
  commits: number
  chatContext: string
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
}

interface Collision {
  type: string
  severity: string
  message: string
  detail: string
  affected: string[]
  suggestion: string
  status: string

2. **Semantic Understanding**: Understands the meaning of development work, not just task tracking - knows what developers are actually working on and why

3. **Proactive Conflict Prevention**: Prevents conflicts before they happen by detecting collision patterns and suggesting coordination, rather than managing conflicts after they occur

4. **Automated Knowledge Management**: Successful solutions are automatically captured and made searchable for future similar problems, creating compound team intelligence

5. **Personal Development Focus**: Beyond team coordination, helps individual developers improve their AI interaction patterns and coding productivity
